	<h3>Brain dump of all the things I thought about when having this idea.</h3>
	<p>This is a MEANJS app so follow their instructions for what to install, then clone it and with mongo running run grunt
		to get it running.</p>
	<p>
	If you amend the blocks with the actual times, you could make the blocks more accurate - making them fuzzy with a + or - on their timing.
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>Internationalise</h4>
	All models must be user restricted - add user to each model and restrict on routes
	</p>
	<h4>Settings</h4>
	Time segment size
	language
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>Calendar Display</h4>
	user sets time segment size - eg 15mins
	Display monthly line
	Display daily line
	Have a space for unscheduled blocks to generate into
	underneath have a Generate block form.
	Slide the line or use the goto box to get the line where you want to insert, then hit the insert button on the block - this will autofill the start
	Generate a block without a start time and it will appear in the Unscheduled Block space
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>TimeBlocks Side Display - don't think so</h4>
	drag and drop - this seems maybe not worth it
	new blocks are added and sit until they are dropped into spaces on the timeline
	life blocks are templated and fixed to the timeline and repeat automatically
	can be adjusted, but should be roughly accurate - this is how to have a life :-)
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>TimeBlock</h4>
	Category:  main category - (work/life/?)
	SubCategory:  sub category - will determine charge per hour and adjustment for work - impacts? if life
	DateTime:  start time - optional, if not set will be set from position on timeline
	DateTime:  end time/duration - will determine block size
	Number:  ?padding - inside block/outside bloc/both? - minutes
	Repeat:  repeat - optional - daily/weekly/workdays/monthly
	Number:  work?charge per hour - see sub category - can be overridden - what you're planning on charging
	Number:  work?cost - ie expenses - how much did the room hire/coffee cost you
	Number:  work?actual amount charged - will be auto generated from charge per hour, but can be overridden
	Number:  work?actual balance - ie actual amount charged minus any costs
	ImpactCategory:  ?impact category - health/finance/relationships/business
	Number:  ?impact effect +- number 1-10?
	String:  ?notes
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>Other Models</h4>
	Category - String:
	SubCategory
	String: name
	Number:  work?charge per hour - see sub category - can be overridden - what you're planning on charging
	Number:  work?cost - ie expenses - how much did the room hire/coffee cost you
	Number:  work?actual amount charged - will be auto generated from charge per hour, but can be overridden
	Repeat
	ImpactCategory
	</p>
	<p>
	TimeBlock templates should be easily imported/exported so people can exchange them and the app can be shipped with a customised set of models
	JSON seems obvious - anything better? properties format maybe
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>TimeBlock templates</h4>
	Main Category - LIFE
	Sleeping
	Getting ready
	commuting - driving/walking/cycling
	cooking
	eating
	household chores
	recreation - walking
	health - running
	growth - meditation
	</p>
	<p>
	Main Category - WORK
	user specific - but could ship with web developer/mobile developer - anything we can get from people using it
	</p>
	<p>
	<h4>VIEWS</h4>
	owner view
	shared view
	reports
	work life balance
	health/leisure etc - by sub category
	finances/accounting
	</p>
	<p>
	Finance Blocks and Timeline
	income and outgoings per month
	</p>
	<p>
	Blocks could be for any measurable finite resource - Time/Money are obvious
	They need a line to stack them on to show
	</p>
	<p>
	Loading from configuration
	Import/Export a config file
	Export/Import JSON straight into the database
	</p>
	<p>
	Problems
	Passing all the data - this is how apps like this work - do some performance testing
	</p>
	<p>
	If you call something more than once - move it from the controller to a service.
	Move stuff from rootscope to a service scope?
	If you use the service a few times - modularise it
	Services hold state - controllers don't
	</p>
